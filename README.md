### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and as of right now I am near the end of my second year. With this in mind I have learned various languages such as Python, C++ and Java, with little experience in Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) and Database Handline (SQL). As an Artificial Intelligence student I have experimented with Machine Learning algorithms, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Robotics.

If anyone would like to contact me, I can be reached by sending an email to owenagius24@gmail.com.
