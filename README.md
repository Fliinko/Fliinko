### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and as of right now I am near the end of my second year. With this in mind I have learned various languages such as Python, C++ and Java, with little experience in Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP), Database Handline (SQL) and some Data Science (R, Python). As an Artificial Intelligence student I have experimented with Machine Learning algorithms, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Robotics. Some of my more interesting projects in the field consist of Human Activity Recognition from Smartphones, Detection of Constellation Images and Sentence Generation. All of my work can be found on my profle, all of my finished work is on a public repository.

If anyone would like to contact me, I can be reached by sending an email to owenagius24@gmail.com.
